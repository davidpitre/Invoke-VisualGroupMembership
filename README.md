## Invoke-VisualGroupMembership

#### Example Script

The goal of the script was to help visualise which users are members of more than one primary group below an OU level. 
Due to Forcepoint requiring that users are a member of only a single policy that is filtered by Security groutp, this script should help to validate that users have not been accidently included in two or more policies.
